Hi, I'm Caitlin.

I moved from San Diego, CA to Seattle, WA in 2021, and I've loved waking up to lush greenery and mountains ever since.

This website is a home to my interests and a way to share with my friends -- without using social media. Here, I will catalogue my film photos, books, pottery pieces, and whatever else comes to mind.
